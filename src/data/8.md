# Stop 8 ‚Äì Variables, integers, assignment, and counting diamonds

Variables are your backpack. You put values in, take them out, and update them as you go. Today, Steve will walk right while you count how many diamonds are beneath his feet. Along the way, you‚Äôll learn what ‚Äúassignment‚Äù really means and how to do simple arithmetic and increments.

---

## What a variable is

A variable is a named storage location that holds a value. You choose a name (like `diamonds`) and assign it a value (like `0`). Later, you can read that value, change it, or use it in calculations.

- **Name:** The identifier you write (e.g., `diamonds`, `steps`, `score`).
- **Value:** The data stored (e.g., an integer like `0`, `1`, `42`).
- **Type:** What kind of data it is (e.g., int for whole numbers).

---

## Assignment explained clearly

Assignment uses the single equals sign `=`. It means ‚Äúevaluate the expression on the right, then store that result into the variable on the left.‚Äù It does not compare; it binds a name to a value.

- **Direction:** Right side first (compute the value), then put it into the left side variable.
- **Overwrite:** Assignment replaces whatever the variable held before with the new value.
- **Example:**
  - `diamonds = 0` sets `diamonds` to zero.
  - `diamonds = diamonds + 1` reads the current value of `diamonds`, adds one, then assigns the result back into `diamonds`.

Common confusion:
- **`=` (assignment)** changes a variable.
- **`==` (equality comparison)** checks whether two values are the same and returns True/False. It does not change anything.

Increment shorthand:
- **`x += 1`** is the same as `x = x + 1`.
- You can use other compound assignments: **`x -= 2`**, **`x *= 3`**, **`x /= 4`**.

## Integers and basic arithmetic

Integers (int) are whole numbers. You‚Äôll use them to count, add, and accumulate totals.

- **Addition:** `a + b`
- **Subtraction:** `a - b`
- **Multiplication:** `a * b`
- **Division:** `a / b` (produces a float). If you need an integer division, use `a // b`.

Tip:
- **Type conversion for printing:** Concatenating strings requires strings, so wrap numbers with `str(...)`: `print("Total: " + str(diamonds))`.

---

## Mission goals and ore intel

Steve will walk right until Bedrock stops him. At each step, look below. If the block under Steve is Diamond Ore, increase your `diamonds` count by 1.

- **Block names:** "Bedrock", "Stone", "Diamond Ore", "Gold Ore", "Coal Ore".
- **Goal:** Keep moving right while the right block isn‚Äôt Bedrock; count diamonds underfoot.

---

## Example code with assignments and increments

```python
print("Starting rightward diamond count...")

diamonds = 0  # assignment: put 0 into the variable named 'diamonds'

while check_right() != "Bedrock":
    move_right()

    # assignment via increment when we find a diamond
    if check_down() == "Diamond Ore":
        diamonds += 1  # same as diamonds = diamonds + 1
        print("Found a diamond below! Total so far: " + str(diamonds))

print("Bedrock reached on the right. Total diamonds: " + str(diamonds) + " üíé")
```

What‚Äôs happening, line by line:
- **`diamonds = 0`:** Assignment initializes your counter to zero.
- **`while check_right() != "Bedrock":`** Keep looping until the next right block is Bedrock.
- **`move_right()`:** Move right; now Steve stands over a new block.
- **`if check_down() == "Diamond Ore":`** Comparison checks the block below Steve.
- **`diamonds += 1`:** Increment assignment updates your tally when a diamond is found.
- **`print(...)`:** Convert the integer to a string for display.

---

## Assignment patterns you‚Äôll use often

- **Initialization:**  
  **Purpose:** Set starting values.
  
  - **Example:**
    - `steps = 0`
    - `diamonds = 0`

- **Accumulation:**  
  
  - **Example:**
    - `diamonds = diamonds + 1`
    - `diamonds += 1`

- **Reassignment:**  
  **Purpose:** Replace a previous value entirely.
  
  - **Example:**
    - `mode = "search"`
    - `mode = "mine"`  (now the old value is gone; `mode` holds "mine")

---

## Common pitfalls to avoid

- **Mixing up `=` and `==`:** `if x = 1` is invalid in Python; use `if x == 1`.
- **Forgetting to initialize:** Using `diamonds += 1` before `diamonds = 0` causes an error because `diamonds` wouldn‚Äôt exist yet.
- **String vs int in prints:** `"Total: " + diamonds` fails; use `"Total: " + str(diamonds)` or `print("Total:", diamonds)`.

---

## Practice boosters

- **Challenge A:** Also count Gold Ore underfoot. Use two variables:
  - `diamonds = 0`
  - `gold = 0`
  - When `check_down() == "Gold Ore"`, do `gold += 1`.

- **Challenge B:** Count any ore underfoot using a single check:
  - If `"Ore" in check_down():` then `ore_total += 1`.

- **Challenge C:** Stop early when you‚Äôve found 3 diamonds:
  - Inside the loop, after incrementing, add `if diamonds == 3: break`. (Break exits the loop immediately.)

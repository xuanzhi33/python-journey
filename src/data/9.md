# Stop 9 – Free Play: The Map Is Yours 🌍✨

The next chapter is still being written, but for now you’ve unlocked a **bigger, more complex map**. This is your sandbox moment: you can use everything you’ve learned so far to experiment and explore.

- Want to **dig straight down** until Bedrock? Go for it.  
- Want to **sweep left and right** to grab every ore? That works too.  
- Or maybe you feel like going wild and **mining every single block**—that’s allowed!  

The point is: there’s no single “correct” solution here. This stage is about **practice and mastery**. By combining `while` loops, `if` checks, and mining functions, you’ll reinforce the skills you’ve already learned.

## Suggested challenge ideas
- **Ore Hunter:** Count how many ores of each type you can collect.  
- **Tunnel Maker:** Dig a long horizontal tunnel until Bedrock stops you.  
- **World Cleaner:** Write a loop that clears every block in sight.

## Reminder of your toolkit
- **Loops:** `while` keeps you going until a condition is met.  
- **Checks:** `check_down()`, `check_left()`, `check_right()`, `check_up()` tell you what’s around Steve.  
- **Mining:** `mine_down()`, `mine_left()`, `mine_right()`, `mine_up()` let you clear blocks.  
- **Variables:** Store counts, totals, or flags.  
- **Assignment:** Use `=` to set values, `+=` to increase them.

💡 Think of this stop as your **training ground**. Play, experiment, and push the limits of what you can do with the tools you already have. The more you try, the sharper your coding instincts will become.

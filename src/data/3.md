# 🌀 Stop 3 – Double the Power with Nested Loops

Steve has mastered simple loops. He can repeat a move again and again without breaking a sweat. But what if we want him to perform a **pattern inside another pattern**? That’s where **nested loops** come in!

## What’s a Nested Loop? 🤔
A **nested loop** is just a fancy way of saying:  
“Put one loop **inside** another loop.”

Think of it like this:  
- The **outer loop** is the big boss—it decides how many times the whole routine should run.  
- The **inner loop** is the worker—it repeats a smaller set of actions each time the boss tells it to.

## Example in Real Life 🌍
Imagine Steve is planting flowers in a garden:  
- The outer loop says: “Do this for **3 rows**.”  
- The inner loop says: “In each row, plant **5 flowers**.”  

So Steve ends up planting 3 rows × 5 flowers = 15 flowers in total. 🌸🌸🌸

## Nested Loops in Python 🐍
Here’s the structure:

```python
for i in range(3):        # outer loop
    for j in range(5):    # inner loop
        move_right()
    jump()
```

- The **inner loop** makes Steve move right 5 times.  
- After finishing one row, the **outer loop** makes him jump to the next row.  
- Then the inner loop starts again, moving right 5 times in the new row.

## Your Mission 🎯
Steve is now facing a **staircase of blocks**.  
To reach the flower at the top, he needs to:  
1. Walk across a few steps.  
2. Jump up to the next level.  
3. Repeat this pattern until he reaches the flower.  

Use **nested loops** to help Steve climb the staircase efficiently.

## 🧪 Experiment Time
- Try changing the numbers in the outer and inner loops.  
- What happens if you swap the order of `move_right()` and `jump()`?  
- Can you make Steve do a little celebration dance at the top using another loop? 🎉

👉 With nested loops, you’ve unlocked a whole new level of programming power. Steve can now handle patterns inside patterns—like a true coding ninja. 🥷

# 🌍 Stop 0 - Welcome to the World of Programming!

So, you’ve decided to step into the mysterious, magical, and occasionally confusing world of **programming**. Don’t worry—it’s not as scary as it sounds. Let’s break it down:

- **Programming** is the art of writing instructions for a machine.  
- A **program** is just a list of those instructions.  
- And here’s the fun part: the machine doesn’t argue, complain, or roll its eyes—it will **always** do exactly what you tell it to do. (Which is both awesome… and sometimes a little dangerous if you tell it the wrong thing!)

## Meet Steve 👋
On your screen, you’ll see a little character. His name is **Steve**.  
Steve is a loyal fellow—he’ll follow your commands without hesitation. You’re basically his boss now. Congratulations!

---

## Giving Commands in Python 🐍
In Python, commands look like this:

```
move_left()
move_right()
jump()
```

- Notice the **parentheses `()`** at the end. Don’t worry about why they’re there just yet—we’ll uncover that secret later.  
- Commands look like short English phrases, but instead of spaces, we use **underscores** (`_`). Think of it as Steve’s way of keeping things neat and tidy.

## ⚠️ Important Note
The commands you’ll see here (like `move_left()` and others we’ll introduce later) are **special functions created just for this tutorial**. They don’t exist in real Python—you can think of them as “training wheels” to help you learn the basics in a fun way. 🚲

## Your First Mission 🎯
Let’s get Steve moving! In the code area on the right, type:

```
move_right()
jump()
move_right()
```

Did you notice that little pop-up that shows up while you’re typing? It’s like your keyboard’s psychic cousin — it tries to guess what you’re about to type next! 😏 At that moment, just hit the **Enter** key, and *boom!* instant autocomplete magic. For example, when you type `move_l` and press **Enter**, voilà — `move_left()` pops up right where your cursor is, like it was waiting for its big debut! 🎩✨

Run the code, and watch Steve shuffle over to stand proudly next to the little flower 🌸.  
(He’s a big fan of flowers, so you’ll make his day.)

👉 Go ahead—give it a try. Steve’s waiting for your orders!

# 🌍 Stop 0 - Welcome to the World of Programming!

So, you’ve decided to step into the mysterious, magical, and occasionally confusing world of **programming**. Don’t worry—it’s not as scary as it sounds. Let’s break it down:

- **Programming** is the art of writing instructions for a machine.  
- A **program** is just a list of those instructions.  
- And here’s the fun part: the machine doesn’t argue, complain, or roll its eyes—it will **always** do exactly what you tell it to do. (Which is both awesome… and sometimes a little dangerous if you tell it the wrong thing!)

## Meet Steve 👋
On your screen, you’ll see a little character. His name is **Steve**.  
Steve is a loyal fellow—he’ll follow your commands without hesitation. You’re basically his boss now. Congratulations!

---

## Giving Commands in Python 🐍
In Python, commands look like this:

```
move_left()
move_right()
jump()
```

- Notice the **parentheses `()`** at the end. Don’t worry about why they’re there just yet—we’ll uncover that secret later.  
- Commands look like short English phrases, but instead of spaces, we use **underscores** (`_`). Think of it as Steve’s way of keeping things neat and tidy.

## ⚠️ Important Note
The commands you’ll see here (like `move_left()` and others we’ll introduce later) are **special functions created just for this tutorial**. They don’t exist in real Python—you can think of them as “training wheels” to help you learn the basics in a fun way. 🚲

## Your First Mission 🎯
Let’s get Steve moving! In the code area on the right, type:

```
move_right()
jump()
move_right()
```

Did you notice that little pop-up that shows up while you’re typing? It’s like your keyboard’s psychic cousin — it tries to guess what you’re about to type next! 😏 At that moment, just hit the **Enter** key, and *boom!* instant autocomplete magic. For example, when you type `move_l` and press **Enter**, voilà — `move_left()` pops up right where your cursor is, like it was waiting for its big debut! 🎩✨

Run the code, and watch Steve shuffle over to stand proudly next to the little flower 🌸.  
(He’s a big fan of flowers, so you’ll make his day.)

---

## 🧪 Experiment and Have Fun!
Feel free to mix and match these commands in any way you like—Steve will always follow your instructions.  
Try out different combinations and see what happens. Who knows, you might discover some cool moves for Steve! 🎉

👉 Go ahead—give it a try. Steve’s waiting for your orders!

## 💬 A Word About Comments

Sometimes you’ll want to leave little notes in your code—messages for *humans*, not for Steve (he doesn’t read English, only commands). That’s where **comments** come in.  

In Python, a single‑line comment starts with the mighty **`#`** symbol. Everything after that on the same line is completely ignored by Python. It’s like whispering a secret to your future self:  

```python
# This is a comment. Steve will never see it.
move_right()  # Steve only cares about this part
```

Think of `#` as the “mute button” for code. You can use it to:  
- Explain what your code is doing.  
- Leave yourself reminders.  
- Or, in our case, **temporarily turn off old code** when moving on to the next chapter.  

So if your editor still has code from Stop 0, but you want to start fresh in Stop 1, just slap a `#` in front of those old lines:  

```python
# move_right()
# jump()
# move_right()
```

Now Steve will politely ignore them, and you can focus on your shiny new adventure.  

---

👉 Pro tip: Comments are like sticky notes for your brain. Use them generously—future‑you will thank past‑you for being so thoughtful.  

Tired of adding `#` one line at a time? Here’s a secret shortcut:  
**Select the code you want to silence, then press `Ctrl + /`.**  

Boom 💥 — every selected line instantly gets a `#` in front of it.  
Press it again, and the `#` disappears, bringing your code back to life like a zombie revival. 🧟‍♂️  

This is super handy when you want to quickly “mute” a whole block of old code from the last chapter, without deleting it.

👉 With this trick, you can keep your editor neat and experiment freely, knowing you can always toggle code on and off in a flash.

# 🔁 Stop 1 – The Magic of Loops!

Steve had a great time following your commands one by one. But let’s be honest—typing the same thing over and over again can get a little… boring.  
That’s where **loops** come in! 🎉

## What’s a Loop? 🤔
A **loop** is like giving Steve a set of instructions and saying:  
“Hey Steve, do this **again and again** until I tell you to stop.”

Instead of writing the same command multiple times, you can use a loop to repeat it automatically.  
Less typing for you, more action for Steve!

## Meet the `for` Loop 🐍
In Python, the most common loop looks like this:

```python
for i in range(3):
    move_right()
```

- `for i in range(3):` → This means: “Repeat the following commands **3 times**.”  
- The **colon `:`** at the end tells Python, “Get ready, here comes the stuff to repeat.”  
- Notice how the command `move_right()` is **indented** (pushed to the right with spaces). That’s Python’s way of knowing which commands belong to the loop.

So instead of writing:

```python
move_right()
move_right()
move_right()
```

You can just write the loop once, and Steve will happily march to the right three times. 🚶‍♂️➡️➡️➡️

## Your Mission 🎯

See? Right now, Little Flower is miles away from Steve — poor guy would have to spam `move_right()` like a maniac just to get there! 😩 So instead of turning him into a keyboard warrior, let’s make life easier (and cooler 😎) by using a **loop** to help Steve stroll smoothly toward Little Flower! 🧍‍♂️➡️🌸
  
In the code area, type....

Nope — I’m not handing you the solution on a silver platter! 🥢 Put on your thinking cap and use what we just learned; I believe you can write the correct code. (If you’re totally stumped, scroll down — we tucked the answer at the end of this chapter like a secret snack.)

Run the code, and watch Steve zoom across the screen like a pro.  
(He’s starting to feel like an athlete now. 🏃‍♂️)

## 🧪 Experiment Time!
- Try changing the number inside `range()`. What happens if you use `range(2)`? Or `range(10)`?  
- Mix in other commands! For example:

```python
for i in range(3):
    move_right()
    jump()
```

Now Steve will move right **and** jump, three times in a row.  
It’s like teaching him a dance routine! 💃

👉 Go ahead—play around with loops. You’ve just unlocked one of the most powerful tools in programming. 🚀

## 💡 Need a Hint?

Here’s one way to get Steve to Little Flower using a loop:

```python
for i in range(19):
    move_right()
```

# üîÅ Stop 6 ‚Äì While loops for reactive movement

You‚Äôve used `for` to march Steve forward step by step. Now let‚Äôs make him more reactive: with a `while` loop, Steve keeps going as long as a condition stays true. It‚Äôs perfect for uncertain paths where obstacles can appear at any time.

## What is a while loop?

A `while` loop repeats a block of code **as long as** its condition is true. When the condition becomes false, the loop stops.

```python
while condition:
    # repeat these actions
```

- **Condition:** Must eventually become false, or the loop never ends.
- **Flow:** Check ‚Üí run ‚Üí check again ‚Üí run again‚Ä¶ until the condition fails.

## Using while with the map‚Äôs right side

In this level, the map is the same as the `if` chapter, but instead of a fixed `for i in range(19):`, you‚Äôll let Steve continue until the right side is no longer empty.

- **`check_right()` returns strings** like `"Air"`, `"Stone"`, or `"Grass"`.
- Use `while check_right() == "Air":` to keep moving right while the path is clear.
- When it‚Äôs not `"Air"`, decide what to do (jump over `"Stone"`, handle other blocks).

```python
while check_right() == "Air":
    move_right()
# Now the path isn‚Äôt clear ‚Äî make a decision with if/elif/else
```

---

## Your mission

- Replace the `for i in range(19):` loop with a `while` loop driven by `check_right()`.
- While the right side is `"Air"`, move right.
- When it‚Äôs not `"Air"`, use `if`/`elif`/`else` to handle obstacles and then continue.
- Keep looping until Steve reaches the flower at the end.

---

## Common pitfalls

- **Infinite loop:** If Steve never changes the situation (e.g., doesn‚Äôt move or jump), `check_right()` may stay the same forever. Make sure each loop iteration progresses the state.
- **Condition updates:** After handling an obstacle, re-check the condition so Steve can continue moving.
- **Unexpected blocks:** Add an `else` to handle anything that isn‚Äôt `"Air"` or `"Stone"`.

---

## Experiment time

- Try different conditions: what happens with `while check_right() != "Stone":`?
- Make Steve announce changes with `print("Ahead:", check_right())`.
- Combine `while` with `if` to create a smart, obstacle-aware runner.

With `while`, Steve becomes responsive to the world‚Äîhe moves because the path is clear, stops when it isn‚Äôt, and adapts in real time. That‚Äôs the heart of interactive programming.

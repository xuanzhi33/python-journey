# 🖨️ Stop 6 – While Loop

Steve has been learning a lot, but now it’s time to introduce him to a new kind of loop: the **while loop**! 🎉

---

## What’s a While Loop? 🤔
A **while loop** is like telling Steve:  
“Keep doing this until a certain condition is no longer true.”

Instead of repeating a fixed number of times (like a `for` loop), a `while` loop keeps going as long as the condition is true.

## Meet the `while` Loop 🐍
In Python, a `while` loop looks like this:

```python
while condition:
    move_right()
```

- `while condition:` → This means: “As long as the condition is true, repeat the following commands.”
- The **colon `:`** at the end tells Python, “Get ready, here comes the stuff to repeat.”
- Just like with `for` loops, the commands inside the loop are **indented**.

For example, if Steve needs to keep moving right until he reaches a flower, you could write:

```python
while not at_flower():
    move_right()
```

This tells Steve: “Keep moving right until you’re at the flower.” 🌸

## Your Mission 🎯

Steve is stuck in a maze! He needs to find his way to the flower, but the path is tricky. Use a `while` loop to guide him:

1. Write a `while` loop that keeps Steve moving until he reaches the flower.
2. Use the `at_flower()` function as the condition.
3. Run the code and watch Steve navigate the maze like a pro! 🏃‍♂️

## 🧪 Experiment Time
- Try changing the condition in the `while` loop. What happens if you use `while True:`? (Be careful—this creates an infinite loop! 🌀)
- Combine the `while` loop with other commands. For example:

```python
while not at_flower():
    move_right()
    if check_up() == "wall":
        jump()
```

Now Steve will move right and jump over walls until he reaches the flower. 🧗‍♂️

👉 With `while` loops, you’ve unlocked a new level of programming power. Use them wisely, and Steve will conquer any challenge! 🚀

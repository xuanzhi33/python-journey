# 🌟 Stop 5 - Mastering the Power of `if` Statements!

Welcome back, adventurer! 🚀 By now, you’ve learned how to move Steve around and interact with the world. But what happens when the path ahead isn’t clear? What if there’s a **random rock** blocking Steve’s way? Don’t worry—this is where the magic of **`if` statements** comes in! 🪄

## What is an `if` Statement? 🤔

An **`if` statement** is like a decision-making tool for Steve. It allows him to **check a condition** and decide what to do based on the result. Think of it as Steve asking, “Is there a rock in front of me? If yes, I’ll jump over it. If no, I’ll keep walking.”

Here’s what an `if` statement looks like in Python:

```python
if condition:
    # Do something if the condition is true
```

- The **`condition`** is something that can be either `True` or `False`.  
- If the condition is `True`, the code inside the `if` block will run.  
- If the condition is `False`, Steve will skip the block and move on.

## Using `if` in the Game 🎮

In this level, Steve will encounter **random rocks** blocking his path. But don’t worry—you can use the `check_right()` function to help him decide what to do.

Here’s how it works:

- **`check_right()`**: This function checks if there’s a rock to Steve’s right.  
  - If there’s a rock, it returns `True`.  
  - If the path is clear, it returns `False`.

Now, let’s combine `if` and `check_right()` to help Steve navigate:

```python
if check_right():
    jump()  # Jump over the rock if there's one
else:
    move_right()  # Otherwise, just keep moving
```

## Your Mission 🎯

Steve needs to reach the flower 🌸 at the end of the path, but there are **random rocks** in his way. Use `if` statements and the `check_right()` function to guide him safely to the goal.

Here’s a starting point for your code:

```python
# Step-by-step instructions to guide Steve
if check_right():
    jump()  # Jump over the first rock
else:
    move_right()  # Move forward if the path is clear

# Repeat the logic for the next steps
if check_right():
    jump()
else:
    move_right()

# Continue adding more steps until Steve reaches the flower
move_right()  # Final step to reach the goal
```

## 🧪 Experiment and Explore!

Feel free to experiment with the code:
- What happens if you remove the `if` statement?  
- Can you make Steve jump over multiple rocks in a row?  
- Try adding comments to explain your logic!

# ⛰️ Stop 2 – Over the Hills and Far Away

Steve is feeling adventurous today. Ahead of him are **three little hills** standing between him and his beloved flower 🌸.  
Your mission: guide Steve so he can climb over each hill and finally reach the flower.

## Loops to the Rescue 🔁
Remember how loops let you repeat actions without writing them again and again?  
Well, climbing a hill is a **pattern**—Steve needs to jump up, move forward, and then? 

Instead of writing that sequence three separate times, you can use a loop to repeat the “hill‑climbing routine” for each hill.  

---

## Hints 💡
- Think about what commands Steve needs to climb **one hill**.  
- Once you’ve figured out the pattern, wrap it inside a loop so Steve can repeat it **three times**.  
- Don’t forget: indentation matters! The commands that belong to the loop must be indented.  

---

## Your Mission 🎯
Write the code that helps Steve:  
1. Climb over the **first hill**.  
2. Repeat the same routine for the **second** and **third hills**.  
3. Reach the flower on the other side.  

---

## 🧪 Experiment Time
- Try changing the number of hills. What if there were **five** instead of three?  
- Can you make Steve do a little **jump of joy** after each hill?  
- What happens if you put different commands inside the loop?

👉 It’s your turn now. Steve is waiting at the foot of the first hill, ready for your instructions.

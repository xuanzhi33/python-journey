# Stop 7 – Read the docs, then mine like a legend

Docs aren’t homework—they’re your cheat codes. Great devs peek at the manual, smirk, and write code that slaps. Today you’ll use a `while` loop that checks below Steve and mines until Bedrock stops you. ⛏️✨

---

## Ore intel you should know

- **Bedrock (B):** Indestructible. Don’t even try. 🚫  
- **Stone (S):** Destructible, not an ore. Not shiny.  
- **Diamond Ore (d):** Destructible, very shiny. 💎  
- **Gold Ore (g):** Destructible, shiny. 🪙  
- **Coal Ore (c):** Destructible, useful. 🧱

Block names are strings like `"Bedrock"`, `"Stone"`, `"Diamond Ore"`, `"Gold Ore"`, `"Coal Ore"`.

## Mining functions

Use these to clear blocks around Steve:

```python
mine_up()
mine_down()
mine_left()
mine_right()
```

---

## Use `while` to dig until Bedrock

Keep digging down as long as the block below is not Bedrock:

```python
while check_down() != "Bedrock":
    # examine below and act
    ...
```

This keeps the loop running until the check becomes false, then stops when Bedrock is reached.

---

## Introduce `!=` and compare with `==`

- `==` checks equality: it is true when the two values are the same.  
  Example: `check_down() == "Bedrock"` is true only if the block below is exactly `"Bedrock"`.  
- `!=` checks inequality: it is true when the two values are different.  
  Example: `check_down() != "Bedrock"` is true for `"Stone"`, `"Diamond Ore"`, `"Air"`, etc.

Comparison summary:
- Use `==` when you want to run code only if something matches exactly.  
- Use `!=` when you want to continue while something is not yet reached or not that value.

## Mission pattern: concise, adaptive mining

- Goal: From the surface, dig down until Bedrock, mining any ores you find and optionally checking left/right for nearby ores.  
- Use `"Ore" in name` to test if a returned string is an ore.  
- Keep code short with a `while` loop and small repeated checks.

Example pattern:

```python
print("Starting vertical dig...")

while check_down() != "Bedrock":
    if "Ore" in check_down():
        print("Found" + check_down() + "- mining down!")
    mine_down()
    # check neighbors and mine if ore
    if "Ore" in check_left():
        mine_left()
    if "Ore" in check_right():
        mine_right()

print("Bedrock reached. Dig complete. 🏁")
```

Read the docs, trust `in`, use `!=` to keep going until the end, and let Steve do the heavy digging. Short code, shiny results.

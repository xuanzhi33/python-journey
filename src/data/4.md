# 🖨️ Stop 4 – Strings, Return Values, and `print()`

Steve has been moving, jumping... But so far, your code has been a one‑way street: you give commands, Steve obeys.  
Now it’s time for your code to **talk back** to you! 🎉

## Strings: Words in Python ✨
In Python, text is called a **string**.  
A string is just some characters wrapped in quotation marks:  

```python
"Hello"
"Steve likes flowers"
"grass"
```

Think of strings as little speech bubbles 💬 that your code can show.

## The `print()` Function 🖨️
The `print()` function is like a loudspeaker: it takes whatever you give it and shows it in the **Output area**.  

Try this classic first:  

```python
print("Hello World")
```

Run it, and you’ll see the words appear in the Output area.  
Congratulations—you’ve just made your very first program that *speaks*! 🎉  

---

## Return Values 🎁
Some functions don’t just *do* something—they also **return** information back to you.  
For example, the `check_up()` function doesn’t move Steve. Instead, it looks above him and **returns the name of the block** as a string.  

You can send that string straight into `print()` to see it:  

```python
print(check_up())
```

If there’s grass above Steve, the Output area will show:  

```
grass
```

## Your Mission 🎯
1. Start by printing `"Hello World"`.  
2. Use `print(check_up())`, `print(check_down())`, `print(check_left())`, and `print(check_right())` to see what blocks surround Steve.  
3. Watch the Output area as your code finally talks back to you!

## 🧪 Experiment Time
- Try printing your own messages:  
  ```python
  print("Steve is awesome!")
  ```  
- Combine text with a check function:  
  ```python
  print("Above me is: " + check_up())
  ```  
- Can you make Steve announce all four directions in one run?

👉 With strings and `print()`, you’ve unlocked the power of communication. From now on, your programs won’t just *do* things—they’ll also **tell you what’s happening**. 🚀

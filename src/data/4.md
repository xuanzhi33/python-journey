### Stop 4 – Strings, Return Values, `print()` and how to use functions

Steve obeys your commands. Functions are the named actions you call to make Steve do things or to ask him what he sees. You don’t need to write functions yet — just call them.

---

#### Functions as actions you call
- A function is a command you run by writing its name followed by parentheses.  
- Examples you already have: `move_left()`, `move_right()`, `jump()`.

---

#### Parentheses and parameters
- Parentheses after a function name are where you put extra information if the function needs it.  
- Many game commands need no extra info, so you call them with empty parentheses, e.g. `move_right()`.  
- `print()` usually receives data inside the parentheses, for example `print("Hello")`.

---

#### Return values: asking Steve questions
- Some functions return information instead of (or in addition to) acting. These return values are often strings.  
- Example: `check_up()` looks above Steve and gives the block name as a string. You can send that result to `print()`.

---

#### Strings: text in quotes
- Text values are called strings and are written with quotes: `"Hello World"`, `"Diamond Ore"`.  
- You can join strings using `+` to build messages to print.

---

#### Practice example: Check all four directions

Have Steve announce what he sees in each direction. Each `print()` call must take a single argument formed by concatenating a label string and the `check_*()` result.

Example — simple four-line checks:

```python
print("Hello World")
print("Up: " + check_up())
print("Down: " + check_down())
print("Left: " + check_left())
print("Right: " + check_right())
```


Run the snippets and watch the Output area show the block names returned by the `check_*` functions. Empty parentheses on action functions like `move_right()` mean “do it now”; when you want to show text plus a returned string, concatenate them and pass the result as the single `print()` argument.
